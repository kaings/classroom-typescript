    <!-- we can also load the separated js files on the html like this but if we deal with large numbers of files, this is not efficient
    in this case, we try tsc command to merge all the ts files into app.js: 'tsc --outFile app.js calcCircle.ts calcRectangle.ts app.ts'
    But, this is also not very easy since we need to list out all the ts files to be merged by order
    <script src="./calcCircle.js"></script>
    <script src="./calcRectangle.js"></script>
    -->
    <script src="./app.js"></script>
